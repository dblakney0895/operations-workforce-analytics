# Operations Workforce Analytics  
### Workforce Productivity & Performance Variability Analysis  

## Business Context

Retail operations rely on workforce efficiency, labor allocation, and KPI alignment to drive profitability and service quality. Measuring raw output alone does not provide a complete picture of employee performance.

This project evaluates productivity by normalizing output against hours worked to identify performance variability and operational improvement opportunities.

---

## Objective

- Analyze employee productivity metrics  
- Identify performance variability across workforce segments  
- Normalize output to improve fairness and decision accuracy  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for operational improvement  

---

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Cleaning & Validation Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## Analytical Approach

1. Data ingestion and validation  
2. Productivity normalization (output per hour)  
3. Variability and trend analysis  
4. Visualization of performance distribution  
5. Development of business-focused recommendations  

---

## Key Insights

- Normalized productivity metrics provided clearer performance comparisons  
- Identified measurable performance variability across workforce segments  
- Highlighted the importance of KPI standardization in workforce evaluation  

---

## Business Impact

This framework can support:

- Fair performance evaluation  
- Data-driven workforce planning  
- Improved labor allocation strategies  
- Retail operations efficiency improvement
